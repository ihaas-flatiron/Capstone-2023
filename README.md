### Flatiron Capstone
### Ian Haas


### Project Overview
Identify common diseases that manifest on the leaves of cotton plants by comparing images of infected plants with images of diagnosed plants to efficiently identify diseases and lead to faster application of correct treatment.

### Data

Transfer learning with Keras and Tensor flow
MobileNetV2
Feature Extraction and Fine Tuning

Random Transformation for training
Loss: Cross Entropy , Accuracy
Optimization: Adam Optimizer RMS Propagation

### For the Future
Optimization: Improve model with more data
Specialization: Tailor to individual farming operations and specific species and crops 
Versatility: Identification on individual basis, possibly with mobile devices in the field, as well as systemic identification through tools like drone photography
