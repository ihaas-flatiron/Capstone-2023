# Classifying Leaf Diseases of Cotton Plants
### Flatiron Capstone
### Ian Haas


### Project Overview
Identify common diseases that manifest on the leaves of cotton plants by comparing images of infected plants with images of diagnosed plants to efficiently identify diseases and lead to faster application of correct treatment.

### Data
Leaf images data set: Easily classifiable, visually identifiable; leaves are more photogenic
Cotton Plant: Valuable commodity and large component of agriculture industry
Sample Data: Randomly selected example of each class from data set

Transfer learning with Keras and Tensor flow
MobileNetV2
Feature Extraction and Fine Tuning



Random Transformation for training
Loss: Cross Entropy , Accuracy
Optimization: Adam Optimizer RMS Propagation

### For the Future
Optimization: Improve model with more data
Specialization: Tailor to individual farming operations and specific species and crops 
Versatility: Identification on individual basis, possibly with mobile devices in the field, as well as systemic identification through tools like drone photography
